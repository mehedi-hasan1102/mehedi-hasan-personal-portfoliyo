Writing clear and professional Git commits is more than a habit—it’s a skill that makes collaboration smoother, code history readable, and debugging easier.

▪ Structure of a Good Commit
1) Type – feature, fix, docs, etc.
2) Short message – 50 characters max
3) Optional detailed description – wrap text at 72 characters

▪ Common Commit Types
feat: Adding a new feature
fix: Bug fix
docs: Documentation-only changes
style: Formatting, missing semicolons
refactor: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
test: Adding or updating tests
chore: Maintenance tasks

▪ Pro Tips
Always use imperative mood, keep commits focused, include context when necessary.
