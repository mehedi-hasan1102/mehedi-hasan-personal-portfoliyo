## 🌱 My Journey Through Failure and Meditation

Life rarely unfolds according to plan. For me, the years surrounding my HSC examinations became a defining chapter—one marked by failure, self-doubt, and eventually, transformation.

## 📉 2013–2014: Failure, Pressure, and Depression

In **2013**, I failed my HSC examination. The weight of expectations—from family, society, and myself—felt unbearable. I gradually slipped into **clinical depression**, feeling lost and directionless.

I attempted the exam again in **2014**, hoping for redemption. Unfortunately, I failed **once more**. That second setback was devastating. It forced me to confront deep questions about my worth, ability, and future.

> *Sometimes failure is not the end of the road—it is the beginning of a different path.*

## 🔄 2015: A Turning Point Through Meditation

Amid frustration and emotional exhaustion, I discovered **meditation**. Initially, it was simply a way to quiet my anger and rest my mind. I learned through **books** and practiced basic techniques at home.

In **2015**, I sat for the HSC exam again—and this time, I **passed**.

More important than the result was the internal shift. Meditation helped me develop:

* Patience during uncertainty
* Focus under pressure
* Self-discipline in daily life

For the first time in years, I felt calm, confident, and grounded.

## 🧘 2018: Learning Structured Meditation

From **February 16–19, 2018**, I received formal meditation training from the **[Quantum Foundation](https://quantummethod.org.bd/)**.

This experience deepened my understanding and practice. From that point onward, meditation became a **consistent part of my life**, not just a coping mechanism.

## 🌟 How Meditation Changed My Life

Meditation brought measurable, lasting change:

* **Anger Management** — I no longer react impulsively or hold unnecessary frustration
* **Healthier Habits** — Reduced destructive patterns and improved daily routines
* **Emotional Stability** — Greater resilience during stress, failure, and uncertainty
* **Self-Awareness** — Clearer understanding of thoughts, emotions, and behavior

Meditation is no longer something I *do*—it is a way I *live*. It helped me rebuild myself after repeated failure and develop a mindset rooted in patience, growth, and inner balance.
