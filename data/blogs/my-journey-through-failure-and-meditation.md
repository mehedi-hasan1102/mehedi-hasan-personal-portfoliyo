# 🌱 My Journey Through Failure and Meditation

Life doesn’t always go as planned. For me, the years around my HSC exams were some of the toughest moments of my life.

## 2013-2014: Struggling with HSC and Depression

In **2013**, I failed my HSC exam. The disappointment and pressure were overwhelming, and I slipped into **clinical depression**. I felt lost, frustrated, and hopeless.

I tried again the next year, in **2014**, but unfortunately, I failed **again**. The repeated setbacks made me question everything about myself and my future.

> "Sometimes failure is the beginning of a new journey, not the end of the road."

## 2015: Turning Point Through Meditation

During this period of intense frustration, I discovered **meditation**. Initially, it was just a way to calm myself, to relieve anger and negative emotions. I practiced meditation using **books** and simple exercises at home.

In **2015**, I gave the HSC exam once more—and this time, I **passed**! This success wasn’t just about passing the exam; it was a turning point in my life. Meditation had taught me **patience, focus, and self-discipline**, helping me regain confidence and composure.

## 2018: Learning Structured Meditation

From **February 16–19, 2018**, I had the opportunity to learn meditation in a structured way from the **Quantum Foundation**. This experience deepened my practice and understanding.

From that time until now, meditation has **completely transformed my life**.

## 🌟 Changes Meditation Brought in My Life

- **Anger Management:** I’ve lost the habit of being easily frustrated or angry.  
- **Better Habits:** Meditation helped me eliminate destructive habits and focus on healthy routines.  
- **Emotional Balance:** I can now handle stress, disappointment, and challenges calmly.  
- **Self-Awareness:** I’ve learned to understand my thoughts, emotions, and behavior patterns better.

Meditation isn’t just a hobby—it’s a **way of life**. It helped me recover from failure, build resilience, and develop a mindset that embraces growth, patience, and inner peace.

> *✨ Keep growing, stay patient, and embrace your journey!*
