title: The Right Way to Send Your Resume via Email (With Free Template)
category: Career
description: Learn the correct way to email your resume professionally with a template.
---


We’ve all seen job descriptions that say: “Send your CV/Resume via email.”
And most people? They just attach the PDF and hit Send.

But here’s the catch 👇
If you don’t write anything in the email body, you’re missing a big opportunity.

👉 A short, professional email body shows HR that you’re serious, polished, and respectful of their time.

So, let’s fix that.

In this post, I’ll share:
 

(1) The right way to send your CV.
(2) A simple email template you can use right away.
(3) A few must-follow tips to make a great impression.

📩 Professional Email Template

Here’s a clean and effective format you can copy-paste (and personalize to your style):

```
To: [Company Email Address]  
Subject: Application for [Position Name]  

Dear [Hiring Manager's Name],  

I’m excited to apply for the [Position Name] role at your company,
 as advertised. My skills, qualifications, and experience align 
 closely with the requirements of this position.  

Please find my CV and supporting documents attached for your review.  
I’d welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your
team and look forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best regards,

✅ Quick Tips Before You Hit “Send”

 Always use PDF format → Avoid .doc, screenshots, or scanned files.
(1) Polish it up → Double-check grammar & spelling (tiny mistakes leave a big mark).
(2) Use a professional email address → firstname.lastname@gmail.com looks clean.
(3) Skip the funky ones → funkyboy99@gmail.com won’t help your chances 😅.
(4) Check your attachment → Don’t be that person who forgets to attach their CV.

💡 Final Thoughts

(1) Your CV matters, but often your first impression starts with the email you send.
(2) A short, respectful message + a well-formatted PDF CV = a much better shot at catching HR’s attention.

If this helped you, pass it on to a friend who’s job hunting. They’ll thank you later. 🙌
